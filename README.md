# Olibhia's Portfolio

Hi, I'm Olibhia Ghosh, a Full Stack Developer and Technical Writer. I love building projects and making open source contributions.

## Description

I started my journey as a developer in 2023. I have a passion for writing and sharing my knowledge with the community. I also love building projects and contributing to open source. I'm currently looking for new opportunities.

This portfolio is a Next.js application styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a clean, modern design with a light and dark mode toggle. The layout is responsive and designed to provide a seamless user experience across different devices. The portfolio includes sections for my work experience, education, skills, and projects. It also has a contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.
